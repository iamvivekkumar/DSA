        //Given two sorted linked lists consisting of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to merge both of the list (in-place) and return head of the merged list.
        //Example 1:

        //Input:
        //N = 4, M = 3 
        //valueN[] = {5,10,15,40}
        //valueM[] = {2,3,20}
        //Output: 2 3 5 10 15 20 40
        //Explanation: After merging the two linked
        //lists, we have merged list as 2, 3, 5,
        //10, 15, 20, 40.
        //Example 2:

        //Input:
        //N = 2, M = 2
        //valueN[] = {1,1}
        //valueM[] = {2,4}
        //Output:1 1 2 4
        //Explanation: After merging the given two
        //linked list , we have 1, 1, 2, 4 as
        //output.
